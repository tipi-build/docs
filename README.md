### What can I do with Tipi?
Tipi is a suite that combines 3 main tools to achieve fast, easy and scalable Rust and C++ development:
* A build cache connected straight to sources in git repositories
* Build environments provisioning on powerful cloud build machines with hundreds of cores and terrabytes of RAM
* Cross platform compilation on Linux, Windows, MacOS or custom.

### How can I start building with Tipi in the cloud?
To get the full Tipi experience we offer our users a free trial.

### Can I build with Tipi locally?
Yes! You can start building with Tipi using your sources on your machine, no need to sign-up if you don't plan to depend on dependencies requiring authentication.

### Is Tipi Open Source?
We believe in the power of the community and that is why we created tipi free forever and tipi is an open source project. You can access our Open Source projects on [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/tipi-build/).

For team remote building and company-wide usage we also have a commercial offer with [Tipi Pro](/pricing).
